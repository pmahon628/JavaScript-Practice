quick read me for this game.

Basic Rock Paper Scisssors game using vanilla JS.  I am working on my JS skillset and will peridocially refactor and improve this code to make it better.  For example - game currently works as is, pretty basic, no styles but below is a list of improvements I plan on making over time and will timestamp them when done.

- JS SIDE:
    - change if/else for logic to switch/case


CSS Side
   - actually add styles such as flexbox, images instead of words - i.e - icons for R P S

   Thanks!
